        <h2>The purpose of these labs is to help maintain interest in product/application development beyond our initial trainings, as well as serving as an incentive for the host Universities to be involved in our training program.   We want these labs, like the course, to be available to as many people as people, so weâ€™re primarily considering campus locations that are part of very large state-run Universities.</h2>
